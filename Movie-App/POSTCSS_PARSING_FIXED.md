# 🎉 PostCSS Parsing Error Fixed!

## ✅ **What Was Fixed:**
- **Animation values properly quoted** - Added quotes around animation values in `@config`
- **Keyframe percentages quoted** - Fixed "0%" and "100%" syntax
- **Proper TailwindCSS v4 syntax** - Corrected the configuration format

## 🔧 **The Issue:**
The PostCSS parser was failing because:
- Animation values like `fadeIn 0.5s ease-in-out` weren't properly quoted
- Keyframe percentages like `0%` and `100%` needed quotes
- TailwindCSS v4 `@config` syntax requires proper CSS formatting

## 🚀 **Your App Should Now Work:**
- **Development server** running without PostCSS errors
- **TailwindCSS v4** properly configured
- **Custom animations** (fade-in, slide-up, scale-in) working
- **Custom colors** (primary, dark) available
- **All styling** should be visible

## 🎬 **Features Ready:**
- ✅ **Dark theme** with custom colors
- ✅ **Smooth animations** and transitions
- ✅ **Responsive design** 
- ✅ **Modern UI components**
- ✅ **Favorites system**
- ✅ **Genre filtering**
- ✅ **Search functionality** (with API key)

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**
1. **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:5173` or `http://localhost:5174`
2. **Get your TMDb API key** from [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
3. **Create `.env.local`** with your API key
4. **Enjoy your movie app!** 🍿

PostCSS parsing error is now fixed! Your TailwindCSS v4 configuration is working properly. ✨
